  <h1>Downsides of React and Redux</h1>
  <p>
    <b>Right Now:</b>
    What we have done so far about react and redux is that
    we passed our store in a "prop" to our main app component.

    And then inside of our app component, we could do whatever
    we want with the actual store. So here, we're calling
    "store.subscribe" to listen for changes to the store.

    We call "store.dispatch" to get the initial data for our
    application, and the we call "store.getState" as well to
    get specific slices of our store, and then we pass all of
    that data, including the store itself, down to theses
    children components.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    <b>Downside:</b>
    The above works with our small app, but as our grows,
    that's not really going to be super realistic, because
    essentially, what will have to do is we'd have to plum
    the store down to any component that needs it. And again,
    if we have like 10 nested components, the we'd have to
    pass a store down 10 layers, and it just really wouldn't
    scale that well.

    And another thing we're doing is we're updating our app
    whenever anything changes. So if we had a really big app
    because we're calling "store.subscribe", and specifically,
    "forceUpdate" in our main app component whenever any of
    our data changes, our entire app is re-rendering.

    Ideally, what would happen is we would just render
    components whose data has changed rather than
    re-rendering every component ir our application.

    <b>Solution:</b>
    So I want you to think about if were tasked building
    a library to extract some of these rought parts,
    how would we actually do it?

    What we have to do is implement a way of getting the
    state, updating the state, and listening for changes
    on the state work as smoothly with the React as
    possible.

    We search how every component in our application can
    easily get access to the store, whether that's to get
    the state, update the state, or listen to the state
    changes, nothing else we do will matter. The second thing
    we'd want to look at is related to getting data from the
    store to our component. And even more important, as I
    mentioned earlier only re-rendering those components
    when the data they need from the store changes.

    Right now, the way we're solving this is by just calling
    our getState method here at the root of our application
    and passing that data down to any components that need
    it. Just like with the store, that's going to scale very
    well. If we can find and create a nice abstraction for
    getting this store to any component that needs it, and
    only re-rendering components when the exact data they
    need change, we'll improve pretty much every aspect of
    our current code base.
    <br /><br />
    So, we're going to think about how React and Redux
    work together, and we're going to create a nice
    abstraction over Redux in order to better and more
    smoothly implement with our current React application.
